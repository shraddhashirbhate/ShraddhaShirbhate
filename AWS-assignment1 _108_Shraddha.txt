1)What is cloud?
=============

"The cloud" refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software
 and databases that run on those servers. Cloud servers are located
 in data centers all over the world. By using cloud computing, users and companies 
don't have to manage physical servers themselves or run software applications on their own machines.

In cloud the users can access data (files and application) via internet with any local devices
that has a connection to internet, meaning they dont have to manage the data locally, this is how 
we can access emails even after switching our devices and still able to view instagram photos or answers 
on quora without saving them  locally.

2) Different  type of cloud?
=====================
Private cloud: A private cloud is a server, data center, or distributed network wholly dedicated to one organization.
===========
example= USA government has bought a private cloud from amazon.

Public cloud: A public cloud is a service run by an external vendor that may include servers in one or multiple data centers.
==========   Unlike a private cloud, public clouds are shared by multiple organizations. Using virtual machines,
	       individual servers may be shared by different companies, a situation that is called "multitenancy" because multiple
	       tenants are renting server space within the same server.
	       example= AWS- amazon web services, azure- microsoft.

Hybrid cloud: Hybrid cloud deployments combine public and private clouds, and may even include on-premises legacy servers.
===========  An organization may use their private cloud for some services and their public cloud for others, 
	         or they may use the public cloud as backup for their private cloud.
 	         microsoft- azure.
	         Amazon Web Services (AWS)

3) Pro and cons of cloud?
   ===================
 PROS
======

1)Cost Savings:
Cost saving is the biggest benefit of cloud computing. It helps you to save substantial capital cost as it does not need any physical hardware investments. 
Also, you do not need trained personnel to maintain the hardware. The buying and managing of equipment is done by the cloud service provider.

2) latest technology:
Cloud computing offers a competitive edge over your competitors. It helps you to access the latest and applications any time without spending your time and money on installations.

3)High Speed
Cloud computing allows you to deploy your service quickly in fewer clicks. This faster deployment allows you to get the resources required for your system within fewer minutes.

4)Back-up and restore data
Once the data is stored in a Cloud, it is easier to get the back-up and recovery of that, which is otherwise very time taking process on-premise.

5)Reliability
Reliability is one of the biggest pluses of cloud computing. You can always get instantly updated about the changes.

6)Mobility
Employees who are working on the premises or at the remote locations can easily access all the could services. All they need is an Internet connectivity.

7)Unlimited storage capacity
The cloud offers almost limitless storage capacity. At any time you can quickly expand your storage capacity with very nominal monthly fees.

8)Collaboration
The cloud computing platform helps employees who are located in different geographies to collaborate in a highly convenient and secure manner.

9)Quick Deployment
Last but not least, cloud computing gives you the advantage of rapid deployment. So, when you decide to use the cloud, your entire system can
 be fully functional in very few minutes. Although, the amount of time taken depends on what kind of technologies are used in your business.

CONS
=====

Performance Can Vary
When you are working in a cloud environment, your application is running on the server which simultaneously provides resources to other businesses.
 Any greedy behavior or DDOS attack on your tenant could affect the performance of your shared resource.

Technical Issues
Cloud technology is always prone to an outage and other technical issues. Even, the best cloud service provider companies may face this type
 of trouble despite maintaining high standards of maintenance.

Security Threat in the Cloud
Another drawback while working with cloud computing services is security risk. Before adopting cloud technology, you should be well aware of the fact that you will be sharing all your
 company's sensitive information to a third-party cloud computing service provider. Hackers might access this information.

Internet Connectivity
Good Internet connectivity is a must in cloud computing. You can't access cloud without an internet connection. Moreover, you don't have any other way to gather data from the cloud.

Lacks of Support
Cloud Computing companies fail to provide proper support to the customers. Moreover, they want their user to depend on FAQs or online help, which can be a tedious job for non-technical persons.
